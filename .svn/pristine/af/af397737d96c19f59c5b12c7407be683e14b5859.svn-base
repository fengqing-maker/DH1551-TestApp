 * As far as possible these types are target independent. Where needed
 * definitions for a compiler have to be made.
 * Floating point types are not supported as they are non-portable.
 * Currently there is no support to determine endian type of the compiler.
 *
 * All types specify in their type the required size. These sizes must be met.
 * All types are defined in the form:
 *         ia_[u|s]<type>[<size>]
 * where:
 *        - u indicates unsigned, s indicates signed, if omitted it will compiler dependant or defined by the type.
 *        - <type> indicates the type. Options are: char, int, word and bool
 *        - <size> indicates the size of the type (in bits). Options are: 8, 16 and 32
